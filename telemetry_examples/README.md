## Telemetry Examples

This module contains a set of examples on how to use the telemetry SDK. 
They are full examples, which should compile and be runnable as-is. 

You will need to provide your Insights Insert Key and the New Relic Metric API endpoint as 
command-line parameters to the programs.

#### [BoundaryExample.java](src/main/java/com/newrelic/telemetry/examples/BoundaryExample.java)

and how you can see what happens when things go wrong.

#### [RetryingExample.java](src/main/java/com/newrelic/telemetry/examples/RetryingExample.java)

This is an example of how to use the provided `com.newrelic.telemetry.RetryingTelemetrySender` to handle
errors in the recommended way.
